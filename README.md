# Newsletter-sign-up

## My Awesome Project
This is a newsletter page that has a form with an input and button, the form takes in an email validates it and submits the email address if its valid.



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React framewoek

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.



## Lessons Learned:

i learnt how to use the useSate hook to control error states in the newaletter page
